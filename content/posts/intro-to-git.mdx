# Welcome, Adventurer!

Today we embark on a journey into the realm of **Version Control**. Git is your trusty companion for tracking changes in your code.

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system that helps you:

- Track changes in your code over time
- Collaborate with other developers
- Experiment safely with branches
- Roll back to previous versions if needed

## Your First Commands

Let's start with the basics. Open your terminal and try these commands:

```bash
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Stage all files for commit
git add .

# Create your first commit
git commit -m "My first commit"
```

## Understanding the Workflow

1. **Working Directory**: Where you edit your files
2. **Staging Area**: Files you've marked for the next commit
3. **Repository**: The history of all your commits

## Next Steps

Now that you've made your first commit, you're ready to learn about branches and remote repositories. But first, prove your knowledge by completing the quest below!
